(Put overall project goals here)


Week of 11/12/18

11/12/18
Outage, did not come int

11/13/18
Met with Dr. Evert in the morning, set up a repository, found some resources that could be useful, and ran a CannyEdge algorithm in a Jupyter Notebook.
Later worked on organizing repository, reading through resources, and working through what to do with the canny edge algorithm.
Tomorrow: Need to open up VM and finish fixing Python3 and Jupyter.

11/14/18
Came in at 3:00 and worked on reading through more resources as well as running through an
example of image manipulation. Was able to pull colors out, invert colors, and greyscale
it as well as a few other things.

Tomorrow I will segment that image, and several others and analyze the code that does it.

11/15/18
Today was the Research Fair, so I took care of that then caught up on homework in BTA for the rest of the day.
Will accomplish the task I set out yesterday tomorrow.

11/16/18
With Extra-life happening, I also was not able to make time to come in today.


Week of 11/19/2018 (Thanksgiving Break)
A short week, hoping to wrap up my stuff on Monday

11/19/2018
Today, I finished up my stuff by segmenting my Zelda images using python code. From here, I need to do it with a database of ~10 images.


Week of 11/26/2018

11/26/2018
Did a little work on segmenting multiple images, as well as did some reading. I think I can use an array, then iterate through it to load them all and then segment them all. That may not be the most efficient however. I'll have to do some more looking into it.

Time:                             2:00-3:45
Hours:                            1.75

11/27/2018
Spent much of today messing around with programming ideas as well as reading through one of the papers.

Time:                             10:00-12:50, 2:30-4:50
Hours:                            ~4


11/28/2018
I spent about 3 hours today working through the machine learning book, whcih is proving to be a much beter resource than the computer vision text
I also have.

Time:                            2:00-5:00
Hours:                           3



11/29/2018
I did some reading on the Intro to MCMC paper. I hope to be able to have some findings by the end of tomorrow.

Goals for tomorrow: have something to look into for Monday on putting some code down.

Time:                            10:00-12:00, 2:45-5:00
Hours:                           4.25
