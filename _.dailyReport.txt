(Put overall project goals here)


Week of 11/12/18

11/12/18
Outage, did not come int

11/13/18
Met with Dr. Evert in the morning, set up a repository, found some resources that could be useful, and ran a CannyEdge algorithm in a Jupyter Notebook.
Later worked on organizing repository, reading through resources, and working through what to do with the canny edge algorithm.
Tomorrow: Need to open up VM and finish fixing Python3 and Jupyter.

11/14/18
Came in at 3:00 and worked on reading through more resources as well as running through an
example of image manipulation. Was able to pull colors out, invert colors, and greyscale
it as well as a few other things.

Tomorrow I will segment that image, and several others and analyze the code that does it.

11/15/18
Today was the Research Fair, so I took care of that then caught up on homework in BTA for the rest of the day.
Will accomplish the task I set out yesterday tomorrow.

11/16/18
With Extra-life happening, I also was not able to make time to come in today.


Week of 11/19/2018 (Thanksgiving Break)
A short week, hoping to wrap up my stuff on Monday

11/19/2018
Today, I finished up my stuff by segmenting my Zelda images using python code. From here, I need to do it with a database of ~10 images.


Week of 11/26/2018

11/26/2018
Did a little work on segmenting multiple images, as well as did some reading. I think I can use an array, then iterate through it to load them all and then segment them all. That may not be the most efficient however. I'll have to do some more looking into it.



11/27/2018
Spent much of today messing around with programming ideas as well as reading through one of the papers.



11/28/2018
I spent about 3 hours today working through the machine learning book, whcih is proving to be a much beter resource than the computer vision text
I also have.




11/29/2018
I did some reading on the Intro to MCMC paper. I hope to be able to have some findings by the end of tomorrow.

Goals for tomorrow: have something to look into for Monday on putting some code down.




11/30/2019
Alright, I think I want to start with a Sobel filter. It was developed in the 70's and seems to be one of the simplest. It finds the edges based on the derivative, which I understand as well. 
I want to understand this one at the logical level so I know what I'm doing going forward so I'm going to try to write this myself in Python (with a bit of help of course).

              



Week of 12/3/2018


12/3/2018
I got surprised today by a group project that I thought would be completed, but alas teammates never fail to let you down.
I spent most of today working on that, but finished it up and came in for an hour. Looked through chapter 1.2.2 of my Machine Learning Text.




12/4/2018
Today I looked into Sobel filters, and copied some code. It didn't seem to actually save correctly, but I think I understand the logic. I don't know if OpenCV
does not exist anymore or I will just need to install it manually from the source code. I will try that route tomorrow. 




12/5/2018
Came in today and got to work on just getting a Sobel filter working. I 
got it finally, then worked the rest of the time on understanding what it 
was doing. Felt like it was a pretty productive day today. 



12/6/2019
I spent a lot of time in lab today, but most of it was trying to take care of NASA Internship stuff. I also applied for the NASA L'Space program for this next spring.
I picked out the 5 internships to look at for next meeting, as well as started looking for conferences. I also read through another chapter of the Machine Learning book.
I need to find out how I can get my Sobel filter to not have the image size hard coded, so I need to retrieve the height and width from the image properties somehow. There
is most likely a package that will let me do that. 




12/7/2018
Today was mostly spent looking through papers related to the seminal work on the Sobel Filter, and learning how to retrieve image metadata in python. It went pretty well
I think. 




Week of 1/7/2018
I am back from winter break, and ready to work. My goals for this week are to fix the hard coded issue in my sobel filter, look through some of the Robot OS documentation,
and read through the papers that were finalized on finals week. 

1/7/2018
Alright, I got the hard coded issue fixed, and read through some ROS documentation. 
The rest of the day I worked on getting opencv in python. I didn't think it would be a problem, but installing it through the ubuntu terminal is not working, and the source
code isn't much better. 



1/8/2019
Admittedly, Forgot to update the 8th and 9th.



1/9/2019
Same as the 8th.



1/10/2019
Alright, so I've made some progress. I decided I'd install OpenCV, since it's used in ROS quite a bit, and also pertains to my current project. I've got a successful installation, but now I do not know how to 
use it.... I can't even open an image in with it, and, frankly, the tutorials on their website are frustrating. It uses a lot of jargon that's just going over my head and none of it is explained. I'll keep at it for a bit longer though. I think I can crack it with enough time. 

1/11/2019
OpenCV seems to work, using C++. I have managed to get positve tests on Sobel, Canny Edge Detecter, and a Prewitt filter. Next week I want to get that to work in Python.
